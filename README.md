# COllegeBound
COllege Bound is an app based around Colorado Colleges and Universities. Students can look through those options in-state, see important information about them, mark them as favorites, and mark whether or not they have applied to them. It will host important dates and remind students when deadlines are approaching. 

The user will be able to filter through cards of colleges from a directory. Once they are favorited, they will go to the favorites tab, once they are chosen on the favorites to apply to, they will go to a todo list. The to-do list can be marked applied or not applied. This will be linked to a calendar that will send push notifications around upcoming deadlines

There will be a bottom navigation bar that you can flip between the different pages
